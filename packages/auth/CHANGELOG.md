# @navigraph/auth

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`e2a5b81`](https://github.com/Navigraph/sdk/commit/e2a5b819e061ff566ef05fef35a9ef994a035399) Thanks [@SkySails](https://github.com/SkySails)! - Remove built-in QR generation methods in favor of custom platform-specific solutions.

  This was done because most implementors want to pick their own library and also because the one that was used was not really browser-compatible out of the box.
