Added `NavigraphTileLayer`, a Leaflet `TileLayer` that implements Navigraph enroute tiles.
The aim with this extension is to help developers by making the following features available:

- Switching of source between VFR, IFR and world map
- Changing of the theme between day and night
- Automatic handling of credential expiry, with useful hints in the log when something does not look quite right.
